A multi-agent Claude Code workspace in a few minutes, without setting anything up by hand.

It installs [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) and [herdr](https://herdr.dev), then opens a workspace where two Claude Code agents work side by side:

- **coordinator**: the one you talk to. It plans the work and hands research to the researcher.
- **researcher**: reads, searches and reports back, without changing anything.

Each runs in its own folder under `~/agents`, with its role in a `CLAUDE.md` you can edit.

## Install

**Windows** (PowerShell):

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rodnavarro/skills/main/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**macOS and Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rodnavarro/skills/main/install.sh | bash
```

Then run `herdr`. The first time, each tab asks whether you trust its folder: choose **Yes**. Sign in to Claude when it asks.

## What it sets up

| | |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | Installed with Anthropic's installer, if it's missing. |
| **herdr** | Installed with herdr's installer, if it's missing, with the **catppuccin** theme (only when you haven't picked a theme). Use it on a black terminal background; the default Windows Terminal profile already is one. |
| **Status line** | At the bottom of Claude Code: context used, the 5-hour and 7-day limits with the time until they reset, the model and the git branch.<br>`c 25% \| 5h 17%  3h51m \| 7d 21%  2d2h \| Opus 5.5 \| main`<br>Green under 50%, yellow from 50%, red from 80%. |
| **Workspace "main"** | Tabs **coordinator** and **researcher**, each starting Claude Code. Open more tabs from herdr, or ask the coordinator to. |

Running it again is safe: every step that's already done is skipped. Nothing is deleted, and any file it changes is backed up next to itself first (`*.bak-<date>`).

## Files

- `install.ps1`, `install.sh`: the installers.
- `skills/set-status-bar/`: the status line as a Claude Code skill (`SKILL.md`), with its script (`scripts/statusline.cjs`, Node.js) and a PowerShell twin for Windows without Node.js (`scripts/statusline.ps1`). Ask Claude to "set my status bar" to run it on its own.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`: this repo as a Claude Code plugin marketplace, with one plugin, **status-bar** (`skills/set-status-bar/`). Its SessionStart hook keeps `~/.claude/statusline.cjs` up to date, so an organization can give everyone the status line from its managed settings, with nothing to install by hand:

  ```json
  {
    "extraKnownMarketplaces": { "rodnavarro-skills": { "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "rodnavarro/skills" } } },
    "enabledPlugins": { "status-bar@rodnavarro-skills": true },
    "statusLine": { "type": "command", "command": "node \"$HOME/.claude/statusline.cjs\"" }
  }
  ```

  Needs Node.js on every machine.
- `skills/claude-aliases/`: Claude Code aliases as a skill: a command like `claude-work` that starts Claude Code with its own login, settings, skills and history, kept apart from plain `claude`. It covers creating, signing in, listing, renaming, removing and fixing aliases. Ask Claude to "add a Claude alias" to run it.
- `herdr/config.toml`: herdr's theme.
- `roles/coordinator.md`, `roles/researcher.md`: each agent's role, copied to its folder as `CLAUDE.md`.

## If Claude shows in black and white, or says "Transcript saving is off"

The full warning is `Transcript saving is off — inherited CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION marker`. Both come from the same place: a herdr server started by an agent (for example, when you ask Claude to run this installer) passes that Claude session's markers to every pane, `NO_COLOR=1` and `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION=1` among them. The installer now removes them before it starts herdr and when it starts Claude in each tab. A herdr server that was already running with them keeps them: run `herdr server stop` from your own terminal, not from Claude, and open `herdr` again, which closes every tab.

## Trying it without touching your setup

`SETUP_ENV_SESSION=<name>` puts the workspace in a separate herdr session, `SETUP_ENV_AGENTS_DIR` puts the agents' folders elsewhere, and `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` points Claude Code's settings to another folder. A Claude alias (the `claude-aliases` skill) does that last part for you, one command per account.
